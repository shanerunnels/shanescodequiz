If this doesn't work, there is a screen shot of the project in the assets folder. Still couldn't figure out how to add an image.

# description

To start off, I did not finish this project. I didn't manage my time very well this week, so I ran out. 
Speaking of time, please wait until the timer is done because I couldn't figure out how to jump to the end
when the questions have run out. 
But I do believe that the code that you'll find is clean and at least meets some of the criteria. 
Like always, even though I did not finish it, I hope you'll appreciate the movie reference in it. 

# criteria

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
